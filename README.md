## Lab 1: MapReduce
In this lab you'll build a MapReduce system. You'll implement a worker process that calls application Map and Reduce functions and handles reading and writing files, and a coordinator process that hands out tasks to workers and copes with failed workers. You'll be building something similar to the MapReduce paper. (Note: the lab uses "coordinator" instead of the paper's "master".)

## Lab 2: Raft
This is the first in a series of labs in which you'll build a fault-tolerant key/value storage system. In this lab you'll implement Raft, a replicated state machine protocol. In the next lab you'll build a key/value service on top of Raft. Then you will “shard” your service over multiple replicated state machines for higher performance.

In this lab you'll implement Raft as a Go object type with associated methods, meant to be used as a module in a larger service. A set of Raft instances talk to each other with RPC to maintain replicated logs. Your Raft interface will support an indefinite sequence of numbered commands, also called log entries. The entries are numbered with index numbers. The log entry with a given index will eventually be committed. At that point, your Raft should send the log entry to the larger service for it to execute.

You should follow the design in the extended Raft paper, with particular attention to Figure 2. You'll implement most of what's in the paper, including saving persistent state and reading it after a node fails and then restarts. You will not implement cluster membership changes (Section 6).

## Lab 3: Fault-tolerant Key-Value Service
In this lab you will build a fault-tolerant key/value storage service using your Raft library from lab 2. Your key/value service will be a replicated state machine, consisting of several key/value servers that use Raft for replication. Your key/value service should continue to process client requests as long as a majority of the servers are alive and can communicate, in spite of other failures or network partitions. After Lab3, you will have implemented all parts (Clerk, Service, and Raft) shown in the diagram of Raft interactions.

This lab has two parts. In part A, you will implement the service without worrying that the Raft log can grow without bound. In part B, you will implement snapshots (Section 7 in the paper), which will allow Raft to discard old log entries. Please submit each part by the respective deadline.

## Lab 4: Sharded Key-Value Service
In this lab you'll build a key/value storage system that "shards," or partitions, the keys over a set of replica groups. A shard is a subset of the key/value pairs; for example, all the keys starting with "a" might be one shard, all the keys starting with "b" another, etc. The reason for sharding is performance. Each replica group handles puts and gets for just a few of the shards, and the groups operate in parallel; thus total system throughput (puts and gets per unit time) increases in proportion to the number of groups.

The main challenge in this lab will be handling reconfiguration -- changes in the assignment of shards to groups. Within a single replica group, all group members must agree on when a reconfiguration occurs relative to client Put/Append/Get requests. For example, a Put may arrive at about the same time as a reconfiguration that causes the replica group to stop being responsible for the shard holding the Put's key. All replicas in the group must agree on whether the Put occurred before or after the reconfiguration. If before, the Put should take effect and the new owner of the shard will see its effect; if after, the Put won't take effect and client must re-try at the new owner. The recommended approach is to have each replica group use Raft to log not just the sequence of Puts, Appends, and Gets but also the sequence of reconfigurations. You will need to ensure that at most one replica group is serving requests for each shard at any one time.

This lab's general architecture (a configuration service and a set of replica groups) follows the same general pattern as Flat Datacenter Storage, BigTable, Spanner, FAWN, Apache HBase, Rosebud, Spinnaker, and many others. These systems differ in many details from this lab, though, and are also typically more sophisticated and capable. For example, the lab doesn't evolve the sets of peers in each Raft group; its data and query models are very simple; and handoff of shards is slow and doesn't allow concurrent client access.
